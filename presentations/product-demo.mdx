<Section title="The Challenge" layout="centered" emphasis="subtle">
  Traditional analytics tools are complex, slow, and require technical expertise. Teams spend 80% of their time preparing data instead of analyzing insights.

  **Common Pain Points:**
  - Complex setup and configuration processes
  - Slow query performance on large datasets  
  - Steep learning curve for non-technical users
  - Limited collaboration and sharing capabilities
